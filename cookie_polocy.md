# 🍪 Cookie Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

Hey there, AI fam! Welcome to **Neural Nexus**, where we keep things smooth and personalized with the help of cookies. Nah, not the chocolate chip kind, but the tech kind that make your browsing experience on our platform straight fire! 🔥 This Cookie Policy breaks down what cookies are, how we use ‘em, and how you can control ‘em. Let’s dive in with some Gen-Z energy! 🚀

## 🌟 What Are Cookies?

Cookies are tiny data files that chill on your device when you visit Neural Nexus. They help us remember your preferences, keep you logged in, and understand how you vibe with our site. Think of them as little digital sticky notes that make your experience way more lit! 📝

## 🍪 Types of Cookies We Use

We use a few different cookies to keep the platform running smooth:

- **Essential Cookies** 🔑: These are must-haves to make the site work. They handle stuff like logging you in, keeping your session active, and securing your account. Can’t turn these off—they’re the backbone!
- **Preference Cookies** 🎨: These remember your settings—like dark mode or language prefs—so you don’t have to reset every time you roll through.
- **Analytics Cookies** 📊: We use these to track how you interact with Neural Nexus (anonymously, fam!). They help us see what’s poppin’ and what needs a glow-up.
- **Marketing Cookies** 📣: These help us show you relevant ads or promos based on your interests. We don’t spam, just keepin’ it tailored!

## 💡 How We Use Cookies

Cookies help us:

- **Keep You Logged In**: No need to sign in every time. Stay connected, hassle-free. 🔐
- **Personalize Your Vibes**: Suggest models or content based on what you’ve checked out before. 🛠️
- **Improve the Platform**: See which pages slap and which need work, so we can level up the UX. 🚀
- **Secure the Hub**: Spot weird activity and protect your account from sketchy stuff. 🛡️
- **Show Relevant Ads**: If we run ads, cookies help make sure they’re stuff you might actually care about. 💸

## 🤝 Third-Party Cookies

Some cookies come from our trusted partners:

- **Analytics Tools**: Like Google Analytics, to track site traffic (no personal deets stored).
- **Payment Processors**: Stripe or Razorpay might drop cookies for secure transactions.
- **Social Logins**: Google or GitHub cookies help with one-click sign-ins.

These partners follow strict privacy rules, and we don’t let them misuse your data. We’ve got your back! 💪

## 🛠️ Your Cookie Choices

You’ve got control over cookies, fam:

- **Browser Settings**: Most browsers let you block or delete cookies. Check your browser’s privacy settings to tweak ‘em. Heads up—blocking essential cookies might mess with site features. 🖥️
- **Cookie Banner**: When you first visit, we’ll pop up a banner asking for your consent (where required by law, like in the EU). You can opt in or out of non-essential cookies. 🍪
- **Clear Data**: Wanna start fresh? Clear your browser data to wipe cookies. Just know you’ll be logged out.

## 🌍 Where Cookies Live

Cookies are stored on your device, but data from analytics cookies might travel to servers worldwide via our partners. We ensure they meet privacy standards like GDPR or CCPA, no matter where they’re at. 🌐

## ⏳ How Long Cookies Stick Around

- **Session Cookies**: These vanish when you close your browser. Quick vibe check, then they’re gone. ⏳
- **Persistent Cookies**: These hang out longer (up to 2 years) to remember your prefs or track analytics. We keep ‘em fresh with regular expiry.

## 🔄 Updates to This Policy

Tech moves fast, so we might update this policy. We’ll notify you of changes via a site banner or email if it’s a big deal. Stay tuned! 🔔
