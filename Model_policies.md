# Model Policies

**Last Updated: January 2025**

At **Neural Nexus**, we aim to host innovative AI models while maintaining standards of fairness, safety, and legitimacy. These Model Policies outline the guidelines for uploading, sharing, and utilizing AI models on our platform.

## Acceptable Model Types

We support diversity in AI development. Acceptable models include:

- **Functional AI Models**: Upload operational machine learning models including NLP, computer vision, audio processing, generative AI, and other innovative approaches. Models must function as described.
- **Open Source Models**: We provide dedicated space for free, open-source models inspired by the Transformers library from Hugging Face.
- **Premium Models**: You may list models for sale in our marketplace with transparent pricing and licensing terms.
- **Datasets for Training**: Training datasets may be uploaded provided they are legal, ethical, and properly labeled as datasets rather than models.

## Upload Requirements

To maintain quality and protect users, all uploads must meet these requirements:

- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive README or description with your model explaining functionality, usage instructions, and hardware/software requirements.
- **File Formats**: Utilize standard formats such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, or zipped archives with clear instructions. Non-standard formats require detailed implementation guidance.
- **Size Limitations**: Models exceeding 10GB require advance notification to our team for storage planning.
- **Versioning**: For model updates, clearly label versions (e.g., v1.0, v2.0) and maintain a changelog.
- **Testing**: All models must be tested prior to upload. Non-functional models will be flagged.

## Prohibited Content

To maintain platform integrity and ethics, the following are not permitted:

- **Malicious Models**: Models containing malware, backdoors, or harmful code are strictly prohibited. We scan all uploads and ban violators.
- **Unethical AI**: Models trained on biased, harmful, or illegal data are not permitted. This includes deceptive deepfakes or models promoting hate speech.
- **Unauthorized Work**: Only upload models you've created or have rights to share. Respect intellectual property rights.
- **Inappropriate or Illegal Content**: Models generating explicit content or associated with illegal activities are prohibited.
- **Misleading Claims**: Models must be accurately represented without exaggerated capabilities or performance claims.

## Sales and Licensing

For marketplace sales, please adhere to these guidelines:

- **Transparent Pricing**: Set reasonable prices in USD or cryptocurrency. Platform fees apply (see current terms for fee structure).
- **License Terms**: Clearly specify usage permissions—commercial, personal, or research only. Default licensing is for personal use unless otherwise stated.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Model sales may include permanent ownership transfer via blockchain if you opt-in. Buyers receive full rights, and sellers cannot resell the same copy.
- **Refund Policy**: We manage disputes. Buyers may request refunds within 7 days if models don't function as described.

## Open Source Models

Contributors to our Open Source Models section should note:

- **Free Access**: Models must be available under open-source licenses (MIT, Apache, etc.) without paywalls.
- **Credit & Attribution**: Properly credit original sources if your model builds upon others' work.
- **Community Support**: Provide basic documentation or support for open-source contributions.

## Moderation and Removal

We maintain content quality through:

- **Automated Scanning**: All models undergo malware and performance scans upon upload. Flagged models require review before publication.
- **Community Reporting**: Users may report problematic models, which we investigate promptly.
- **Removal Procedure**: Models violating policies will be removed. Repeated violations may result in account suspension.
- **Appeals Process**: If you believe your model was incorrectly removed, contact mantejarora@gmail.com with supporting evidence for review within 48 hours.

## Policy Updates

As AI technology evolves, our policies will be updated accordingly. We will notify users of changes via email or site notifications.
