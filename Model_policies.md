# 🤖 Model Policies

**Last Updated: January 2025**

What’s good, AI innovators? At **Neural Nexus**, we’re stoked to host your cutting-edge AI models, but we’ve got some ground rules to keep things fair, safe, and legit. These Model Policies cover what you can upload, how to share, and what’s expected when you drop your creations on our platform. Let’s get into it with some Gen-Z flair! 🔥

## 🌟 What Models Can You Upload?

We’re all about diversity in AI, so bring on your best work! Here’s what fits:

- **Functional AI Models**: Upload working machine learning models—think NLP, computer vision, audio processing, generative AI, or anything innovative. Make sure they run as advertised! 🤖
- **Open Source Models**: Inspired by Transformers from Hugging Face, we’ve got a dedicated space for free, open-source models. Share the love with the community! 🆓
- **Premium Models**: Wanna make some bank? List your models for sale in our marketplace with clear pricing and licensing terms. 💰
- **Datasets for Training**: Got data to train models? Upload it as long as it’s legal, ethical, and useful. Label it clearly as a dataset, not a model. 📊

## 📋 Requirements for Uploads

To keep quality high and protect our users, we’ve got some must-dos:

- **Documentation**: Include a README or description with your model. Explain what it does, how to use it, and any hardware/software needs. No vague uploads! 📝
- **File Formats**: Stick to standard formats like TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, or zipped archives with clear instructions. If it’s weird, explain how to run it. 🗄️
- **Size Limits**: Models over 10GB need a heads-up to our team for storage planning. Contact us if you’ve got a big one! 📏
- **Versioning**: Update your model? Label versions clearly (e.g., v1.0, v2.0) so users know what’s new. Keep the changelog poppin’! 🔄
- **Testing**: Test your model before uploading. If it crashes or doesn’t work, it’s getting flagged. Quality over quantity, fam! 🧪

## 🚫 What’s Not Allowed

We gotta draw the line to keep Neural Nexus safe and ethical:

- **Malicious Models**: No models with hidden malware, backdoors, or harmful code. We scan uploads, and violators get banned quick. 🦠
- **Unethical AI**: Don’t upload models trained on biased, harmful, or illegal data. No deepfakes for deception or anything that promotes hate. 🙅‍♂️
- **Stolen Work**: Only upload models you’ve created or have rights to share. No ripping off other creators—respect the hustle! 🛡️
- **NSFW or Illegal Content**: Models generating explicit content or tied to illegal activities are a no-go. Keep it clean for all ages. 🚨
- **Misleading Claims**: Don’t hype your model as something it’s not. If it’s not “state-of-the-art,” don’t claim it. Be real! 🤥

## 💰 Selling & Licensing Models

Wanna sell your model in the marketplace? Here’s the deal:

- **Clear Pricing**: Set a fair price in USD or crypto. We take a small cut (check our terms for the latest fee structure). 💳
- **License Terms**: Specify how buyers can use your model—commercial, personal, or research only. Default is personal use unless stated. 📜
- **Ownership Transfer**: Selling a model can include permanent ownership transfer via blockchain if you opt-in. Buyers get full rights; you can’t resell the same copy. 🔄
- **Refunds**: We handle disputes. If a model doesn’t work as described, buyers can request refunds within 7 days. Test before you list! 🔍

## 🆓 Open Source Models

Got a model to share for free? We’re hyped! Our Open Source Models page, inspired by Transformers, is all about community:

- **Free Access**: Upload models for free use under open-source licenses (MIT, Apache, etc.). No paywalls here! 🕊️
- **Credit & Attribution**: Give props if your model builds on others’ work. Link to original sources or repos if applicable. 🙌
- **Community Support**: Offer basic docs or support for open-source uploads. Help the fam get started with your model! 💬

## 🛠️ Moderation & Removal

We keep an eye on uploads to maintain quality:

- **Automated Scans**: Models get scanned for malware or performance issues on upload. Flagged ones don’t go live till reviewed. 🤖
- **Community Flags**: Users can report broken or shady models. We investigate fast. 🚩
- **Removal Policy**: If a model violates rules, it’s taken down. Repeat offenders risk account suspension. Keep it legit! ⚠️
- **Appeals**: Think we got it wrong? Email us at mantejarora@gmail.com with proof, and we’ll review within 48 hours. 📧
