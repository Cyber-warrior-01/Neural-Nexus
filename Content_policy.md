# 📝 Content Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

Yo, AI creators! Welcome to **Neural Nexus**, where we keep the vibes positive and the content legit. This Content Policy lays out what’s cool to share on our platform and what’s not. We’re all about fostering a creative, safe space for everyone to innovate with AI. Let’s dive in with some Gen-Z energy! 💥

## 🌟 What’s Cool to Share

We’re hyped to see your creations! Here’s the kind of content we love:

- **AI Models**: Upload your dope machine learning models—whether it’s for NLP, computer vision, audio, or anything else. Make sure they’re functional and documented! 🤖
- **Datasets**: Share datasets that help train AI models, as long as they’re clean, legal, and useful to the community. 📊
- **Tutorials & Guides**: Drop knowledge with tutorials, walkthroughs, or tips on building and using AI models. Teach the fam! 📚
- **Community Posts**: Chat about AI trends, ask for collabs, or flex your latest project in our forums. Keep it friendly and relevant. 🗣️
- **Open Source Goodies**: Inspired by Transformers from Hugging Face, we’re all about free models and data. Share your open-source stuff for max impact! 🆓

## 🚫 What’s Not Cool

We gotta draw the line somewhere to keep Neural Nexus a safe space. Don’t post:

- **Harmful or Illegal Stuff**: No content that promotes violence, hate, discrimination, or illegal activities. We’re not about that life. 🚨
- **NSFW Content**: Keep it PG-13. No explicit or adult material—models, datasets, or posts. Let’s respect all ages in our community. 🙅‍♂️
- **Spam or Scams**: Don’t flood the platform with junk posts, ads, or shady links. No phishing or fake models either. We’ll ban that quick! 🛑
- **Malicious Code**: No uploading models or files with viruses, malware, or anything that could mess up someone’s system. Keep it clean! 🦠
- **Stolen Goods**: Only share content you’ve got rights to. No ripping off other creators’ models or datasets. Respect the grind! 🛡️
- **Misleading Info**: Don’t post fake news or deceptive content about AI capabilities. Keep descriptions accurate—don’t hype what your model can’t do. 🤥

## 🛠️ How We Moderate

We’re not here to be the fun police, but we’ve got some rules to keep the platform lit for everyone:

- **Community Reports**: If something’s off, users can flag it. Our team checks reports ASAP to keep the vibes right. 🚩
- **Automated Checks**: We use AI (of course!) to scan for sketchy content like malware or explicit stuff before it goes live. 🤖
- **Human Review**: For tricky cases, our squad steps in to make the call. We aim to be fair but firm. 👀
- **Actions We Take**: If content breaks the rules, we might remove it, warn the user, or suspend accounts for repeat offenders. Let’s not get to that point, fam! ⚠️
