# 🔒 Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

Hey fam, at **Neural Nexus**, we take your privacy seriously. We're all about building trust and keeping your data safe while you innovate in the AI space. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your info when you use our platform. Let's break it down, Gen-Z style! 🚀

## 🌟 What We Collect

We only grab what we need to keep the platform running smooth and personalized for you:

- **Basic Info**: When you sign up, we collect your name, email, and profile deets (like your display name or avatar if you add one).
- **Usage Data**: We track how you vibe with the site—like what models you check out, upload, or download—to make your experience better.
- **Payment Info**: If you buy or sell models, we process payment deets through secure third-party services like Stripe or Razorpay. We don’t store your card or bank info ourselves. 💳
- **Cookies & Tech Stuff**: We use cookies to remember your settings and keep you logged in. Plus, we collect IP addresses and browser info for security and analytics. 🍪

## 💡 How We Use Your Data

We use your info to:

- **Run the Platform**: Keep your account active, process transactions, and let you upload or download models.
- **Personalize Your Experience**: Suggest models or content based on what you’re into.
- **Stay Connected**: Send you updates, newsletters (if you’re subscribed), or alerts about your account. Don’t worry, we won’t spam ya! 📩
- **Improve the Hub**: Analyze usage to fix bugs, add features, and make Neural Nexus even more lit.
- **Keep It Safe**: Detect fraud, prevent abuse, and comply with legal stuff.

## 🤝 Who We Share With

We don’t sell your data—full stop. We only share when it’s necessary:

- **Service Providers**: Trusted partners like Supabase (for auth & storage) or Stripe (for payments) help us run the platform. They’re locked down with strict privacy agreements.
- **Legal Requirements**: If the law comes knocking, we might have to share data to comply with court orders or protect our rights.
- **Community Features**: If you upload a model or comment, your public profile info (like display name) is visible to others. Keep it cool! 😎

## 🔐 How We Protect Your Data

- **Encryption**: Data’s locked tight with industry-standard encryption, both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized peeps on our team can access user data, and only when needed.
- **Security Vibes**: We regularly update our systems to patch vulnerabilities and keep hackers out.

## 🛠️ Your Choices

You’ve got control over your data:

- **Account Settings**: Update or delete your profile info anytime.
- **Cookies**: Adjust browser settings to block cookies (though some features might not work as smooth).
- **Emails**: Unsubscribe from newsletters with one click.
- **Delete Account**: Wanna bounce? Contact us to delete your account and data (some info might stick around for legal reasons).

## 🌍 Where Your Data Lives

We use global cloud services like Supabase, so your data might be stored or processed outside your country. We ensure these providers meet strict privacy standards, no matter where they’re at.

## ⏳ How Long We Keep It

We hold onto your data only as long as needed for the purposes above. If you delete your account, we’ll wipe your personal info within 30 days, unless we’re required to keep it for legal reasons.

## 👶 Kids’ Privacy

Neural Nexus isn’t for users under 13 (or 16 in some regions). If we find out we’ve got data from a kiddo, we’ll delete it ASAP. Parents, hit us up if you’ve got concerns!

## 🔄 Updates to This Policy

We might tweak this policy as the platform grows. We’ll notify you of big changes via email or a site banner. Keep an eye out for updates!
